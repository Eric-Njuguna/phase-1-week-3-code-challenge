DOM Manipulation:
I've created an HTML structure with an input field for adding items, a list container to display items, and buttons for "Add", "Mark Purchased", and "Clear List".

Event Handling:
I've attached event listeners to the 
1. "Add" button to capture user input and add items to the list.
2. list of items to allow users to mark them as purchased.
3. "Clear List" button to remove all items from the list.

Array Management: 
Maintain a JavaScript array to store shopping list items.
